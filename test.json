This price includes utilities; housemates contribute to the cost of toilet paper, hand and dish soap, cleaning supplies, etc. A one month security deposit is required, which is forfeited if the tenant breaks the lease.\n\nThe basement room available has a large window, double bed, a large armoire, two dressers, desk, easy chair and handmade carpet on the floor. The room is about 16'x11.' It is cool in the summer and warm in the winter.\n\nThe house is located in the Midway Neighborhood of St. Paul placed in the center of an active neighborhood with groups that gathers for weekly barbecues, cooking classes, a book club, knitting club and community gardening. We are 3 blocks from the #16 bus stop and the Green Line, light rail. We are 3 miles from downtown St. Paul, and 8.2 miles from downtown Minneapolis. We are 6 miles from the East Bank of the UMN and 4 from the St. Paul campus. We are 3.3 miles from the University of St. Thomas. We are 4 miles from St. Kates. It takes about 30 minutes by light rail\/bus or bike to get to these locations. We have easy access to bike lanes and are within walking distance of 4 grocery stores and 1.8 miles from Como lake. We are also about 5 blocks away from Hwy 94. The address is 1022 Edmund Ave. St. Paul, MN 55104.\n\nHousemates share the entire house which includes an\nupdated kitchen, 2 updated bathrooms, den, living room, dining room,\nstudy, laundry room, sitting room and 7 bedrooms. Lots of flower\ngardens surround the house, and vegetable gardening space is nearby.\n\nWe live a communal lifestyle as friends. Everyone buys and cooks his or her own food and we often have a community meal on Sunday evenings where we each take turns cooking the main dish for this meal. We also enjoy doing fun activities together like biking, bowling, watching movies, ice skating, game nights and dinner parties. This year most of us have bought a membership to the St Paul Chamber Orchestra and have enjoyed the concerts very much.\n\nWe follow a few rules to keep things running smoothly in the house and to reduce cleaning time: We like a clean kitchen, so we wash, dry and put away our dishes, wiping off the counters, stove and table immediately after we cook. We each take a turn during the week to sweep the kitchen floor and wash out a bathroom sink. We each have a weekly chore which takes roughly an hour. Because all of the carpets are handmade orientals, I like to have the living areas vacuumed every week and the bedrooms every two weeks. Doing so reduces the amount of dirt that penetrates and cuts the carpet fibers. We eat only in the kitchen and dining room. We take our shoes off at the door. It is very important that anyone interested household must be willing to clean weekly. \n\nWe try to keep the house quiet. So if people want to play loud music etc, they use head phones. To maintain privacy, we don't have overnight romantic guests. Family and friends visiting from out of town for a short while are fine, however.\n\nSo far, the people living in the house are a woman studying educational policy at Macalaster, a dental student, a woman with a degree in Chinese working at an elementary school, and a young professional with a degree in journalism, who works at a publishing company and I, the homeowner, who enjoys canoeing, reading fiction, history, sociology, spiritual studies, etc., watching period dramas, PBS and British movies and TV series, traveling and hanging out at the house talking. We also have Daisy, a cute cocker spaniel mix.\n\nWe are looking for some one interested in cooperative living, enjoys people, has a steady income, and no furniture since the house is fully furnished, enjoys keeping a house clean and neat, and enjoys hanging out with his or her housemates. \n\nIf you are interested, please tell me about yourself.\n\nThanks for Reading,\nTeresa\n","beds":"7","baths":"2","gender":"Any","address":"1022 Edmund Ave W","city":"St Paul","state":"MN","zipcode":"55104","lat":"44.9582","lng":"-93.1432","buildid":"0","aid":null,"active":"1","notified":"0","updated":null,"created":"2015-04-24 23:24:49","url":"http:\/\/umn.u-swap.org\/housing\/381","images":[{"filename":"http:\/\/umn.u-swap.org\/uploads\/c4b145f89a728e3f4049e00053acf4c0.JPG","thumb":"http:\/\/umn.u-swap.org\/uploads\/thumbs\/c4b145f89a728e3f4049e00053acf4c0.JPG","id":"720","primary":null}],"building_name":null,"floor_plan":null},{"hid":"380","list":"1 Bedroom Sublease for summer!","price":"585","uid":"1867","body":"Looking for a female subleaser starting May 18 till the middle of august.
